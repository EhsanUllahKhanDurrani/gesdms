    <!-- Journey to English Medium -->
    <section class="mb-2">
      <h2 class="section-title">From Urdu to English Medium</h2>
      <p>Originally an Urdu‑medium school, GES DMS has embraced the future by gradually introducing English as the primary medium of instruction. This journey began in early 2020 with intensive teacher training and curriculum development. Today all subjects from Prep to Class VIII are taught in English, giving our students the linguistic competence required to excel in higher education and global careers.</p>
      <p>While English is our medium of instruction, we continue to celebrate and teach our mother tongue. Urdu and Islamiat remain integral parts of our curriculum, ensuring students retain a strong connection to their cultural roots.</p>

    <!-- Community & Future -->
    <section class="mb-2">
      <h2 class="section-title">Community Impact &amp; Future Plans</h2>
      <p>GES DMS is more than just a school; it is a community hub. Our students participate in local service projects, cultural festivals and sports competitions that build civic responsibility. Parents and community leaders collaborate closely with school management to ensure our children receive holistic support.</p>
      <p>Looking ahead, we plan to expand our campus facilities, introduce robotics and coding clubs, and strengthen partnerships with educational institutions worldwide. With your continued support, we will keep pushing the boundaries of what an elementary school can achieve.</p>
